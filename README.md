# What is a framework?

So we get Javascript libraries and frameworks and a Javascript library in the end is a third-party package, doesn't have to be, you could also write it yourself and and just share it across multiple projects but in the end it's a package which you bring into your project that adds certain functionalities. So libraries typically are focused on one or a few core tasks and they help you with that.

Now frameworks on the other hand also are third-party packages, they also add functionalities but typically they add more functionalities, also from different areas and they typically also give you certain rules or certain structure on how you should build your Javascript driven application and therefore they force you into a certain rule set but at the same time by doing that, they often make it easier for you to build an application and make it easier for you to focus on your core business logic and spend less time on all the nitty-gritty details.

So they typically provide a complete structure for building Javascript applications
and the big examples we got there, not the only ones but the big examples we got are Angular, Vue.js and React.js,(React.js is kind of an edge case, it's actually a library but a pretty big one with a bunch of different features built in and it spawned a huge ecosystem that effectively together forms a framework you could say.)

# React.js

React is js library. React’s ultimate purpose is to show content (HTML) to users and handle user interaction.
React is split into to separate libraries.
“React” knows what a component is and how to make components work together.
“ReactDOM” knows how to take a component and make it show up in the DOM.

### Streams

App which handle with:

- react router
- authentication in react using `google OAuth`
- redux form
- CRUD operations in react/redux using `json-server`
- error handling
- react portals
